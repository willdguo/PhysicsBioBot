I was throwing a tennis ball up and down on the car ride to Target for my family's weekly
shopping run, dutifully practicing my hand-eye coordination. Yet, I found that whenever the car
turned, I would always fumble the ball. As a proficient catcher, I knew something was up. After
conducting numerous experiments in a Target shopping cart, 7-year-old me had unknowingly
confirmed the concepts of acceleration and Newton's First Law.
I was introduced to physics through my investigations of the curious phenomena all around me
— ice freezing from top to bottom, paper clips sinking in soapwater, and gyro toys lighting up
when in contact with metallic surfaces. Through Science Olympiad, Science Bowl, and middle
school physics courses, I became fascinated with understanding and assigning terms to
concepts that I had stumbled upon years prior.
In 8th grade, my sister brought to our dinner table the infamous plank-on-rollers physics
problem, inciting hours of debate and discussion and forever igniting my obsession with
Olympiad physics. In my first few years of competitive physics, I struggled to fully grasp more
advanced topics and found many physics problems impossible to solve. Yet, motivated by my
passion for physics, I pushed on. I pored over college textbooks, attended online physics
communities, consulted mentors, studied on MIT OCW, trained on practice problems, and led
my school's Physics Club. I often spent weeks tackling a problem or exploring alternate paths to
an answer on car rides, evening jogs, and in my dreams.
I started to more clearly comprehend the physical world. I learned to calculate the kinematics of
everything from cars and rolling spheres to oscillating charges and elliptically orbiting planets. I
bashed out proofs 10+ times for Carnot engines, Coriolis forces, Kepler's laws, and relativistic
momentum, understanding how the universe worked through each iteration. My infatuation with
physics intensified after seeing the world with such satisfying clarity.
I'm truly honored to be a member of the 2023 U.S. Physics Team, and I cannot wait to discover
and learn even more about our physical world.
I couldn't have done it without the help of those who supported me along the way. Thank you to
Dr. Sanhita and Dr. Chaudhri for solidifying my fundamental understanding of physics. Thank
you to Dr. Tang for guiding me through the complexities of physics with rigor and accuracy. And
lastly, thanks to my family for providing me with endless inspiration and motivation for exploring
physics.

My journey in physics started during my middle school years of Science
Olympiad. When I was younger, I participated in competitions such as Mathcounts and AMC,
but nothing science-related. At the end of my 7th grade year, I tried out for the Science
Olympiad team at my school. As a rookie to the program, I wasn't sure which events I wanted to
do, and ended up choosing a few physics-related events since they seemed interesting.
Throughout the year I gained interest in the field by learning about mechanics in Machines,
electricity and magnetism in Circuit Lab, and a bit of thermodynamics in Density Lab. I came to
realize that physics had put to application one of my biggest strengths in rigorous math, as well
as guided my intuition towards the world. As a few of my friends and I have joked, physics was
just “math with pictures.” Something about discovering the fundamental principles of the
universe and how they fit together was extremely exciting, which led me to pursue this interest
and take my first F=ma exam. Needless to say, my lack of experience as a first-year student
didn't earn me an ideal ranking, but it was a valuable experience.
I attended Troy High School in Fullerton, CA, for its extremely strong Science Olympiad program
as well as the extensive math courses offered there. This was one of the best decisions I have
ever made. For those who already know, Troy is extremely work-intensive, and anyone without
decent time-management skills will struggle in this school. However, it was just the right difficulty
for me to maintain my grades as well as have spare time to socialize and enjoy myself. I was
able to build much more interest and improve my skills in physics.

I have always been fascinated by what variables compel things to happen. The inner
workings of each facet of life have always captured my imagination. When I discovered the field of
physics, I felt as if I had finally found what I was looking for. I had hoped to find something that could
explain every phenomena, and physics does just that.
In fifth grade, I did a presentation on wormholes after watching the movie Interstellar. To
prepare, I read the book The Science of Interstellar, which introduced me to the vast world of
theoretical physics. It piqued my curiosity and opened the door to my physics journey. When I
was in tenth grade, I discovered the US Physics Olympiad competitions. While I was preparing for
those competitions, I uncovered deep connections between numerous branches of physics. The
interwovenness of these subjects catalyzed my interest. The following subjects were all intertwined:
mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and relativity.
Each one of these new discoveries captivated me, and each problem I contemplated
motivated me to explore more. For example, the relation between mass and gravity in mechanics is
analogous to the relationship between charge and the electric force in electromagnetism. As a result,
many of the methods used to solve equations involving gravity could also be used to solve equations
in electromagnetism. Relativity is also almost entirely built on concepts in classical mechanics.
Connections like these that appear throughout physics are what makes the subject so exhilarating.
Now, as I delve deeper into the study of how things work, more theories become intertwined.
In the past, the giants of the field put all of our knowledge of physics into one monumental equation:
the Standard Model Equation of Motion. This incredibly abstract formula can, in theory, explain all
phenomena associated with three of the four fundamental forces of the universe. As I approach the
future, I dream of exploring the driving machinery of the universe and finally reaching the goal of
explaining everything.
Finally, I would like to thank a few individuals. Thank you to my parents and the science and
mathematics community at Buchholz for being ever so supportive all the time. Thank you to Mr.
Frazer for creating that wonderful environment of learning. Thank you to Dr. Jie Gu for the in-depth
explanations to my many questions. Last but definitely not least, a special thanks to Mr. Moody for
introducing me to and teaching me physics, for organizing, proctoring, and creating opportunities to
participate in Olympic physics, and for entertaining my ridiculous theories. Without these people, I
would've had no chance of making it this far, so again, thank you all so much for the support.

Stuffed into an Economy class seat, with the guy next to me spilling his coffee
all over the floor, and the baby two rows back screaming its way through the air, I couldn't have
been happier.
During this flight I took last summer, I was as giddy as a 5-year-old on their birthday from the
moment the engines powered on. Unfazed by the lack of in-flight entertainment, I spent the flight
gazing at the physics experiment unfolding out the window. The wings flexed and danced with
Newton's laws to keep us afloat in the air. Condensation blanketed the smooth surface of the
wings, wisps of delicate mist governed by Bernoulli's law. As we banked in a turn, the wingtips
piercing straight into the smooth blue sky, I sat firmly in my seat instead of tumbling into the
aisle—the marvelous effect of non-inertial reference frames.
A decade earlier, I was obsessed with a different type of plane. My second-grade self would
spend weekends creating one fold after another in pieces of blank white paper, in awe by the
empty canvases of endless possibilities. When I threw my paper planes down the slope in front
of my home, I would watch as some glided gracefully through the air while others took a direct
nosedive into the pavement. For years, even as I innovated my airplanes to fly longer and
faster, why they flew always remained a mystery.
In the early days of the pandemic, I finally found an answer. Quarantined and impossibly bored,
I pulled a dusty physics textbook out of my cabinet and started flipping through the pages.
Initially, I had no clue what I was reading; but as I continued, examining theorems and analyzing
figures, the laws that governed the world around me began to materialize. Soon, I knew why the
wind blew, why a stream of water from a tap narrowed as it fell, why I felt the crunch of frost
under my feet on chilly fall mornings. And as I read, I learned that the mystery of flight that had
puzzled me for so long wasn't a mystery, after all—it was physics.
Physics opened my eyes to the world, and I'm not looking back.
A huge thank you to Ms. Ruda for supporting me throughout my physics olympiad journey. Also,
I am infinitely grateful to Ms. Edstrom, my physics teacher, for showing me that there's so much
more to physics than meets the eye. It's an honor to be apart of this amazing physics
community, and I can't wait to meet everyone at camp!

“If an apple falls, does the moon fall too?”
I've learned gravity three times for this question.
It all started with Michio Kaku's gesticulative retelling of Newton's brilliance. I thought the answer
was obvious: no, the moon can't be falling since it's always floating in the sky.
The moon, as it turns out, is not just floating in the sky like a balloon. It's a massive rock hurtling
through space at unbelievable speeds. And just like an apple falling from a tree, the moon is
constantly falling through space, locked in an intricate dance with our planet that never quite
reaches the ground. That was the first time I thought I had laid that question to rest.
Years later, in my 8th-grade science class, from Tycho and Kepler, I found descriptive laws for
planetary orbits. It was a captivating framework that shed light on the behavior of celestial
bodies, apparently closing the case for me once and for all.
But that was not the end.
In my freshman year, the COVID-19 pandemic granted me an abundance of free time,
prompting me to explore a plethora of online physics resources. Armed with Newton's laws and
armed with time, I delved into the realm of differential equations, seeking mathematical certainty.
Through this pursuit, I eventually arrived at the belief that, much like an apple, the moon does
indeed fall.
Yet, even with this conviction, I still can't be sure. The captivating realms of general relativity and
quantum gravity introduce further complexities and perspectives to consider.
For all its elegance and beauty, physics can be a humbling subject. No matter how much I think
I know, there's always more to discover, more to explore, and more to learn. It's a never-ending
journey, one that requires a willingness to unlearn old ideas and embrace new ones.
But I'm also grateful for the teachers who have guided me along the way. To Mr. Reid, for being
an inspiring teacher who has taught me there is so much to rediscover and reconsider, to Ms.
Liu, for showing me the beauty of mathematics and physics, and to the AAPT, for providing me
with a community of fellow physics enthusiasts, I owe a debt of gratitude.
With their help, I aspire to continue my never-ending quest for knowledge, to embrace both the
familiar and the unexpected, and to embark on a perpetual journey of exploration and
rediscovery in the wondrous realm of physics.

Unlike many of my fellow campers, my physics competition journey didn't start with math.
Neither did it start with HRK.
Physics has always come naturally to me. I've liked asking “why?” ever since I was little, and my
parents often talk about how I'd bombard them with questions, even as a toddler. One of their
favorite anecdotes is how I—then two and a half—was once looking out the car window and
spotted a school bus, and then asked why it was driving backwards. When they informed me
that it wasn't, I was completely baffled by how the bus could appear to be moving backwards
while it was really driving forwards. Then, when I was around 4, and was taught about gravity, I
couldn't stop wondering what mysterious force was preventing the moon from crashing into
Earth.
Later, things came to a head when my ski coach taught 5-year-old me how to carve. I distinctly
remember him asking which spot had the highest speed and which had the highest acceleration
(a question oddly similar to 2021 F=ma #13). I answered correctly, and he asked me how I
figured it out. I said that I could feel it. Perhaps physics does shape the way I perceive the
world.
In elementary school, I was full of dreams. I self-published my first picture book at the age of 6
(and planned to write 8 more sequels, in order to beat J.K. Rowling). I set the goal of solving
cold fusion by the age of 10; I wanted to build my own cell service network to outcompete AT&T.
The list goes on. But of course, most of them popped. Yet, when my school allowed me to take
middle school physics as a 4th grader, my dreams started to get real.
After mastering the subject at a middle-school level, I naturally wanted to take on
algebra-based high school physics. In 5th grade, I began my voyage of serious learning in
Physics with AP Physics 1. I remember sitting there, just having finished Algebra 1 (not even
trig!!), being surrounded by a room of high schoolers. Things were pretty rough in the beginning.
But before I knew it, I was able to draw free-body-diagrams and fluently used vectors and trig
functions. When I took AP Physics 2 the year after, concepts like ““quantum physics”” and
special relativity felt like a breeze. In 7th grade, I managed to score a 5 on the AP Calculus BC
test by simply following along an AP Physics C: Mechanics class. Soon, I was diving into more
advanced math courses as well, like Mutli-Variable Calculus in 8th grade and Linear Algebra
and Differential Equations in 9th in order to pursue more advanced studies in physics.
Olympiad physics turned out to be totally different from the APs. I studied really hard for the
F=ma in 6th grade, but didn't pass. Nonetheless, the training was invaluable for helping me
better understand concepts and improving my problem-solving skills. In 7th grade, I passed
F=ma, and in 8th grade, I made it onto the US Physics team, where I attended virtual camp
throughout the summer. It was really awesome to meet with other kids as passionate about
physics as me, and I particularly enjoyed competing to be the first to submit a solution to the
problem of the day. I am incredibly excited to attend the camp again in June, where I'll be able
to meet others (in person this time!) who share this passion for physics.
My journey into the world of physics would not be possible without my teachers. I owe a lot of
my success in the subject to my high school physics teacher Dr. Mark Hurwitz, who has been
inviting me to high school physics competitions since I was in 5th grade. I'm grateful for his
encouragement and trust in me, such as making me a project lead for USAYPT 2023 as a
freshman. I'd also like to thank the Nueva School for providing me with such a rich and flexible
learning environment. Lastly, I want to share my school's motto of “learning by doing,” which
inspires me to take on challenges even when I don't feel fully prepared for them.

That's such an idealized view of passion that that phrase, or variations of it (replace
physics with any other interest: astronomy, math, etc.), has become somewhat of an inside joke
among my schoolmates (it stemmed from a presentation in which my friend used that as an
opening line, which we found hilarious). But the funny thing is, my autobiography from last year
can probably be reduced to that sentence. I wrote about my initial amazement, my continued
fascination, my wondrous exploration, and very little about the grind—when it felt like physics
didn't love me back, when it was more about the progress than the physics.
I do indeed love physics very much. I love that it provides such exact, complete, and
mathematical explanations about our world. Explanations that let you stare out the window, look
at the rainbow (USAPhO 2022/A3!), and say, “I know why.” From the firing of neurons (USAPhO
2019/B1!) to the shimmering colors on a CD, being able to draw a line of reasoning back to
basic principles in physics is so inherently satisfying for me. This is passion. If it weren't for this
inherent enjoyment I found, I wouldn't have been able to keep coming back and keep learning
enough to get to this point.
But the other half of my journey was something different—it was drive. I remember sections of
textbooks like Morin where I most definitely was not feeling that fire for physics burning in my
chest. But I pushed through and read through the gritty details, chasing that punchline at the
end of the section / chapter (e.g. angular momentum works!). And especially in the week or two
before the USAPhO, this feeling of drive would take over. I would go through practice test after
practice test in that period to make sure I was ready. And this behavior of course derived from
the fact that the USAPhO is a competition, not from any inherent enjoyment of physics.
I mention this because I think this part of studying, especially in the context of academic
competitions, is rarely talked about. In general, we like to present our journeys as neat and tidy
and smooth-sailing—like my opening line—because that's a lot more aesthetically pleasing. But
the reality is that physics hasn't become my life. I like to do other things as well (see my
hobbies :P), and there are times when these other activities may be more appealing than
physics. That's when the external motivation and drive kicks in—whether this stems from 
wanting to make more progress and get to the next “level” of physics knowledge or from
participating in the physics Olympiads.
I believe that these periods of externally motivated progress are necessary to get through
periods of lulls in your passion and are also especially natural in the context of competitions. But
at the same time, running on this sort of motivation for a long time is conducive to burnout, at
least for me. And when burnout does occur for me, I always find it helpful to go back to where it
started. I sit back, look at the physics I've learned in the last “grind”, and try to find the little
things that connect to our real world (atmospheric physics from thermodynamics! Rings of
Saturn from the tidal forces!). And as I do, I'm reminded of the little moments of discovery and
awe throughout my life: watching my physics club advisor create sparks with steel balls on
paper, my 6th grade science laser lab, and reading the Magic School Bus. These moments
(passion) were what got me on physics in the first place, and it's chasing those moments (drive)
that have kept me around all these years. So, I guess to summarize, I'm just trying to say my
journey with physics was a combination of passion and drive, and I think that's OK—it doesn't
have to be a Romeo and Juliet story for you to do well at something.
Anyways, with all that being said, it's really not that deep (bro)—I'm just excited to enjoy physics
with 19 other nerds at camp!

Do you know what it's like to get everything you've wanted? I think I have an idea.
I have to admit that I was blessed from the start. I had a head start as early as kindergarten,
when I went to full-day kindergarten. Then, around 3rd grade, I started doing Kumon
Math--against my will, actually; I used to go on “strikes” and sacrifice video game privileges to
make a point of not doing the Kumon homework. By 7th grade, I was far enough ahead that I
skipped a grade level of math and quit Kumon, after which point I loved math. This went further,
and my high school let me take college classes including Calculus freshman year. I'm incredibly
grateful to my parents and my school for these opportunities (yes, including Kumon).
But this isn't why I tried so hard to be a part of the US Physics Team. I watched countless
YouTube videos about black holes in elementary school and self-studied physics on Khan
Academy during COVID shutdowns, but I always wanted more. I decided, or rather my addictive
personality decided, that I would continue to learn physics.
Using resources like Khan Academy and MIT OCW, I had fun completing coursework up through
some undergraduate physics and math (to anyone aspiring to self-study physics, these are
fantastic resources, and they're totally free). I'll admit, I struggled significantly through the
harder courses, but the satisfaction of a victory heavily outweighs the pain of the struggle--a
philosophy that is 100% the reason why lifting is so fun. I got through most of the available OCW
resources, but I wasn't content with just the knowledge--I wanted more. So I shifted my focus to
Physics Olympiad, which let me set even more ambitious goals than when I just learned for the
sake of learning.
Despite studying hard, I didn't pass the F=ma test the first two times, but the skills I gained
along the way make life seem so much simpler and easier to understand--not to mention how
studying physics taught me how to understand the physical world. Sometimes I can't go to sleep
at night because I'm trying to solve in my head a physics problem inspired by something I saw
that day.
This year, I was optimistic but did not truly expect to get past the USAPhO exam because of
“continuity.” The day I received the Physics Team Invitation email, I was checking my email in
Biology when I saw it and accidentally flung my phone across the room in excitement--can you
blame me when I've been studying for this for years?
Like me, you may have wondered what “a dream come true” is like. I vaguely understand now
what it's like: I want more.
Again, thanks a million to my parents and my school for giving some priceless opportunities to
me. I'm also grateful for the emotional (and financial) support from my family on this journey,
which is an important step toward my greater goal of contributing to the study of physics as a
physicist. I appreciate the work done by Khan Academy and MIT; their resources are genuine
evidence we live in a utopia. Finally, Brobdignagian thanks to Kevin Zhou for his handouts; I will
be spreading awareness of these on the internet since they're so helpful.

My first encounters with physics were likely from watching YouTube about black holes. At the time I
was awed by how black holes could bend space and even attract light, but I was also completely
baffled. The younger me ended up thinking subjects like black holes, and other subjects like relativity
and whatnot were the things top scientists studied, and I would probably only ever be able to
appreciate watered down versions of their work. Well, I was definitely not expecting how things
would turn out.
I loved soccer in primary school and played in Irvine Slammers FC. Soccer game gave me a lot fun.
In middle school, I began to see the beauty of math, and started learning ahead, going through
multiple math textbooks in short period of time. Although I haven’t achieved much in math
competitions (which I plan to change). In the summer of 2022, I was introduced to physics.
I found physics amazing, as I could now begin to understand how the universe worked.
Coincidentally, in history we were learning about the Enlightenment and how Newton came up with
his three fundamental laws. Newton’s ideas created a new way of looking at the universe and people
started looking at it “as one huge, regulated, uniform machine that worked according to natural laws,”
(quoted from our History textbook) and they were probably amazed as they saw the mysteries of the
universe, which had seemed so unfathomable, unfold before their eyes. And now, about three and a
half centuries later, as I sat at my desk learning physics, I felt the exact same way those people had
probably felt.
I was able to learn physics pretty quickly, (maybe because I had established a good foundation in
math, or maybe it was just because I was really enthusiastic and spent a lot of time, and I surely had a
really awesome teacher) and I finished mechanics in about five months, prepared for the F=ma for
about two months, and passed. Although there were quite some ups and downs in the process. After
that, I went over some EM, relativity, and thermodynamics, crossed my fingers for good luck, and
attended the USAPhO. Afterwards I found that I had qualified for the US physics team, which was
quite a surprise, albeit a pleasant one.
Now I feel very honored that I’ve been invited to the US physics team, and I can’t wait to meet the
other campers in person! Finally, I’d like to thank my parents for their continual support and
encouragement. I’d like to thank Dr. Liu who gave me her enthusiasm for physics. I’d like to thank Dr.
Tang for teaching me EM, and I’d like to thank Professor Walter Lewin at MIT for his fun-filled physics
lectures (truly classic). And last but not least, I’d like to thanks Mr. Nzeza and Mr. Siegel in Pine View
School for their help in registering and proctoring my F=ma and USAPhO exams, as well as guiding me
in the AP physics lab. 

Now, where did my physics journey start?
Ever since elementary school, I have loved science, and I saw a flier for Science Bowl tryouts one day in 6th grade.
Very soon afterwards, I signed up and prepared for the day of the tryouts by spewing random questions at my parents.
Excitement was rushing through me as I buzzed on the questions, and I was absolutely ecstatic when I discovered I had
made the team!
Reaching out to me, one of the coaches asked what subject I was interested in the most, and I decided to focus on
physics.
Going to middle school, I still carried that same love for Science Bowl with me.
On the day of the 7th grade Science Bowl team tryouts, however, I didn’t do that well and missed the team.
Not one to give up after a small setback, I decided to grind textbooks in order to bounce back and do better for 8th
grade.
Nothing felt better than the day I participated in the final buzzer round of tryouts and qualified for the team that year.
Although I didn’t make the A team, I still miraculously got to Science Bowl nationals with the B team, which only
solidified my passion for physics!
Going to Science Bowl Nationals sparked many other STEM competition interests of mine, most notably with the AMC
series and with the F=ma.
In late 8th and early 9th grade, I took F=ma courses, and the excellent guidance I received helped me qualify for the
USAPhO that year in 2020!
Very sadly, however, the USAPhO was canceled that year, but I resolved myself to dive deeper into the fascinating world
of physics beyond mechanics and improve.
Every problem I struggled on and every concept I learned only helped to fuel my motivation, as each increase in my
understanding felt deeply satisfying.
Yielding better competition results would require me to pick out some high quality books, so I chose to study HRK,
Mechanics by Morin, and E&M by Purcell.
Of course, my most important guides in the journey through physics and towards qualifying for the Camp have been my
mentors. Shoutout to Kevin Zhou and Dr. Tang.
Under them, I’ve been motivated to work hard to pursue this goal, and I couldn’t have made it this far without them.
Ultimately, the day of the USAPhO came, and I felt that I was as well prepared as I possibly could be.
Pressure was high and there were many moments where I felt like I would crack, but I did my best to stay focused and
keep making progress.
Nearly four years of effort paid off in the end.
Each day that passes reminds me of how soon camp will be, and I couldn’t be more excited to have this amazing
opportunity to learn physics with peers that love physics as much as I do!
Very soon, I hope to improve my lab skills at camp.
Every new tool I learn there will only make me more passionate about physics, and hopefully I’ll carry this love for physics
with me wherever I go!
Reader, if you’re still here, look at the first letter of each sentence

In seventh grade, I read Richard Feynman’s Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman! Through stories of working on
the Manhattan Project, cracking safes, and presenting in front of Albert Einstein, the scenes that have
continued to play vividly in my mind feature Feynman’s impressive ability and Hans Bethe’s even more
impressive ability to make arbitrary arithmetic calculations to great precision in their heads. Despite the
seemingly mathematical nature of such a gift, the understanding that goes into such a capability is in fact
highly physics related, as physicists are often the most familiar with arithmetic manipulation of common
physical or mathematical constants. Reading this and Feynman’s other books sparked in me a profound
interest in physics that has only grown over the years, bringing me to where I am today.
The next step in my physics journey lay in a deep dive in learning all the facets of physics. Despite the daunting
heaps of content that awaited me, a ceaseless curiosity to explore further and to discover the inherent causes
of various physical phenomena drove my learning. What is the physical meaning of displacement current?
Why is a sonic boom a double boom instead of single? Is Faraday’s Law an underlying cause of related
phenomena or merely an observation that is governed by a more fundamental principle? From each new
concept or fact that I learned, there followed a flurry of questions essentially asking “Why?” or “What if?”
Such investigations led me onto paths that would sometimes end with a perceptive explanation from a
teacher or textbook or with a persistent search on Physics Stack Exchange. My unanswered questions
continue to accumulate in a Google Doc. Perhaps some of them will be answered at camp. For me, physics has
embodied a real-life manifestation of Socrates’ famous line: “All I know is that I know nothing.” The more I
learn, the more I find I do not know, and this only fuels my drive to seek further.
Besides pursuing knowledge on my own, I enjoy sharing physics with others as well. When I established the
Physics Club at my high school, I initially aimed to prepare members for physics competitions. However, I soon
found that my preaching of F=ma problems did not appeal to the majority of my audience. With an adjusted
mission statement, our club now focuses primarily on bonding through labs, toying with new physics
equipment, and enhancing classroom learning. I have come to appreciate that a passion for physics can
present itself in various shapes and forms. After all, what can beat hearing a garbled rendition of Happy
Birthday from a simple electronic sound box after realizing that the snap circuit wire wasn’t attached
properly? Recently, our advisor challenged us to recruit girls to our currently all-male club. How to increase
the female presence? Yet another question to seek an answer to at camp.
My physics journey will stretch far off into the distant future, and I am greatly indebted to the numerous
individuals who have helped me to arrive at this checkpoint. Thank you to my parents for their unconditional
love and to my dad for being my anchor when I doubt my physics intuition. Thank you to Dr. Tang for guiding
me through my study of higher level physics, to Mrs. Jenny for her cheers, and to Mrs. Garber for her support
of our club and confidence in my leadership. And thank you to Mr. Feynman, who certainly was not joking
when he lit the filament to the lightbulb of physics inquiry that continues to shine brighter and brighter.

From a young age, I have always been fascinated with math and the sciences. For example, I
“discovered” Fermat’s Little Theorem and the sum of n cubes formulae in third grade. However, I
almost entirely focused on math until 5th grade, when I was gifted the Feynman Lectures on
Physics by my family. I tried reading and learning from them, but I realized that I needed
computational example problems and exercises to fully understand the material. In 6th grade, I
started working through Fundamentals of Physics: by Halliday, Resnick, and Walker instead,
which turned out to be extremely helpful to me. I kept working on the book through 6th and 7th
grade, finishing it in the middle of 8th grade. Luckily, several of my family members are also
physicists, so I asked them occasionally for help whenever I got stuck on a physics problem. As
a family, we often have science-related discussions over the dinner table. In 7th grade, I took my
first F=ma exam. Despite solving around 20 questions, I made a ton of mistakes, and I ended up
only getting a 12, 3 points shy of the cutoff. However, in 8th grade, I got a 20 on the F=ma exam
and qualified for USAPhO 2022. I wasn’t expecting much from my first performance on the
USAPhO, but I managed to get around 3.5 to 4 solves in total. I was pretty proud of my
performance, but I was expecting a bronze medal, maybe even a silver medal if I got lucky.
Meanwhile, I also took the USAJMO that year for the first time, and I managed to get a 28. To
my surprise, this led me to receive an invitation to MOP 2022, which I gladly accepted. 2 days
later, to my even greater surprise, I also got an invitation to the 2022 US Physics Team.
Unfortunately, I had to decline this, as it overlapped with MOP and I accepted that invitation
already. This year (2023), I once again qualified and took the USAPhO, as well as the USAMO
and USNCO. My 4.5-5 solves on the USAPhO got me another invitation to the US Physics
Team, and, to my surprise, my score of 24 on the USAMO barely qualified me for MOP 2023. I
decided to go with choosing the US Physics Team this year, as I am allowed to take the USA
TSTST (the exam given at MOP) remotely. I hope that participating in the US Physics Team
would greatly help me in the future if I chose a career in physics.


This year, I am participating in the event that allows me to join the 2023 U.S Physics
Team because I have been working very hard to reach this level. I think it is an honor to be able to
represent my country this year in physics. I don’t think I could have been able to compete at this level if
it were not for tutors, and the people that support me, such as my parents. I feel that it is important for
me to succeed in math and physics because I am not only representing myself, but I am representing my
school and my state. I have worked very hard to get to this level, and I am very grateful for the
opportunities that I have received. I love being pushed to my limits in terms of learning, and I always
want to gain as much information about math and physics as possible, especially because there is still
more to discover. In my journey to reach this level, I have encountered challenges and obstacles, but I
have always kept a positive attitude and persevered through them. I have developed a strong work ethic
and have learned to manage my time effectively in order to balance my academic commitments and
personal life. I believe that being disciplined and focused are essential qualities that have helped me to
achieve my goals in physics. Aside from math and physics, I enjoy taking a break to enjoy other subjects.
This year, my favorite subject is anatomy and physiology, and in general, I believe I have enjoyed
biological sciences the most. A lot of my friends don’t believe that I do anything outside of math and
physics, but I enjoy playing games, and playing instruments. I really loved performing as a thespian this
year at my school, and it gave me more perspective about activities that aren’t math and physics related.
I’m a big fan of languages, I speak 5 languages (as of writing this), and I hope to dedicate more time to
learn more. Living in the country I am able to have several pets, cats and dogs and even a horse, which I
care for and ride, which is a pleasant way to spend time. In addition to my academic and personal
pursuits, I’ve been volunteering at a cat rescue since I was around 10 years old. This gives me a chance to
help animals in need, as well as give back to my community. Looking ahead, I am excited to continue my
journey in physics and see where it takes me. I hope to use my knowledge and skills to make a positive
impact on the world and contribute to scientific advancements. Beyond that, I am open to exploring
different paths and discovering new passions. Ultimately, I believe that with hard work and dedication,
anything is possible.

Since I was a child, I had an insatiable curiosity about the world around me, but it was in fifth grade that I
discovered the language that could explain it: physics. My curiosity was piqued by a children's book on Albert
Einstein, an outcast who unlocked the mysteries of the universe by thinking outside the box. Enthralled by his
ideas, I begged my parents to buy me my first physics textbook and immersed myself in it as if it were a gripping
novel.
Middle school only reinforced my love for physics. I can still remember the sense of awe I felt when my seventhgrade teacher demonstrated the seemingly magical property of magnets repelling and attracting each other. The
invisible forces at work fascinated me and spurred me to delve deeper into the subject, not for the grades, but for
the pure joy of understanding. I would stay up late, solving problem after problem, each one a thrilling puzzle.
I was first drawn to the world of physics through my own experiences with the world around me — water boiling
in a kettle, a magnet attracting a paperclip, or the spinning wheels of my toy car. From these daily observations,
my interest grew, transforming from a childhood curiosity into a genuine passion. Throughout my participation
in the school science fairs, and junior high physics lessons, I began to apply names and theories to phenomena
that I had observed and pondered for years.
In the eighth grade, my older brother introduced to our family dinner the perplexing puzzle of a ball sliding down
an inclined plane. This sparked hours of lively debate and deep contemplation, permanently igniting my
fascination with the intricacies of physics. Initially, my foray into the world of competitive physics was marked
by trials and tribulations, with many problems seeming impenetrable. Nevertheless, driven by my passion, I
persevered. Gradually, the mysteries of the physical world started unveiling themselves. I was able to
calculate the kinematics of a wide array of objects — from cars and spinning tops to oscillating pendulums and
planets in elliptical orbits. The world took on a new lucidity that fed my growing love for physics.
My love of problem solving and my desire to understand the universe merged into a deep passion for physics.
This passion, which I hope to further cultivate and share with others, has been an integral part of my journey. It
was a huge honor to be selected for physics camp this summer. It provides an opportunity to refine my problemsolving skills, deepen my understanding of the universe, and interact with a dedicated community of physicists.
I would like to thank my family and all the mentors who have guided and supported me in my relentless pursuit
of physics. Their influence has been invaluable and I look forward to the new challenges and learning ahead.
